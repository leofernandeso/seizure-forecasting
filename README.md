# Seizure Forecasting

This repository contains the code that I used for my bachelor's thesis. The purpose of this work was to develop a seizure prediction methodology using data from the Epilepsy Ecosystem platform.

This was a learning experience for me. For this reason, you may find some bad designed code. That's how life goes sometimes.
